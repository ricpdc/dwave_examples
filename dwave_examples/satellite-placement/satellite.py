"""This example is based on a project by Booz Allen Hamilton researchers
[#btkrd]. See also link_.

The problem is to choose k sub-constellations of m satellites such that the
sum of the average coverage within each constellation is maximized.

There are two versions of the data. The first version runs quickly with
Simulated Annealing. The second version is designed for Hybrid Solver Service.
To run the first one, provide the input file 'small.json' and the solver
name 'neal'. To run the second one, provide the input file 'large.json' and
the solver name 'hss'.
