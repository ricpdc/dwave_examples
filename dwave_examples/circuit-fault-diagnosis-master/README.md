# Circuit Fault Diagnosis

Fault diagnosis is the combinational problem of quickly localizing failures as
soon as they are detected in systems. Circuit fault diagnosis is the problem of
identifying a minimum-sized set of components that, if faulty, explains an
observation of incorrect outputs given a set of inputs.

## Usage

Run `demo.py` and then follow the on-screen instructions.

```bash
python demo.py
```

## Code Overview

This code demonstrates the use of the D-Wave system to solve such a problem in
the case of a three-bit multiplier circuit. The user is prompted to enter three
integers: A and B, which are the inputs the circuit is expected to multiply,
and the circuit's output, P, which represents either a valid or incorrect
product of the inputs.

```bash
Input multiplier     ( 0 <= A <=  7):
Input multiplicand   ( 0 <= B <=  7):
Input product        ( 0 <= P <= 63):
```

The algorithm returns the minimum fault diagnosis (the smallest number of
faulty components it found to cause the given inputs and product) and the
number of distinct fault states with this many faults it observed.

## Code Specifics

### Advanced Options

The `--verbose` option displays the valid/fault status of each component for
each minimum fault diagnosis.

```bash
python demo.py --verbose
```

### Interesting Use Cases

A single faulty component leads to five incorrect bits in the product's six
bits (due to the commutative property of multiplication, these are two
isomorphic sets) in these four cases:

```bash
A = 6; B = 5; P = 32
A = 5; B = 6; P = 32
A = 7; B = 4; P = 34
A = 4; B = 7; P = 34
```

Two faulty components lead to all the product's six bits being incorrect (this
is due to the least significant bit being determined solely by one AND gate) in
these four cases:

```bash
A = 6; B = 5; P = 33
A = 5; B = 6; P = 33
A = 7; B = 4; P = 35
A = 4; B = 7; P = 35
```

Four faulty components, which is the maximum number of faulty components for a
minimum fault diagnosis for this circuit, lead to five incorrect bits in the
product's six bits in this case (one of many such cases):

```bash
A = 7; B = 6; P = 1
```

In general, the number of incorrect bits in the product is greater than or
equal to the number of faulty components.
